# COVID-19_EID
This repository contains the code used to generate the model described in "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Social Distancing Interventions to Delay or Flatten the Epidemic Curve of Coronavirus Disease", EID, 2020.

1. The file simCoronavirusSeattle2_EID.py contains all the functions used to run the model.
2. The file generateParamsSim.py generates 1000 parameter sets that were used to run the model and determine the uncertainty around the results.
These 1000 simulations were used to generate the bars in figure 4 in the paper.
